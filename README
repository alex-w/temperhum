= Device =

Cheap unbranded hydro-thermometer. The manufacturer only provides some
basic Windows-only software and incomplete drivers on a CD.

Manufacturer: http://rding.cn/ (eBay store at http://pcsensor.cn/)
Distributor: http://usb.brando.com.hk/ (has some software updates)


= Software =

Aside from the manufacturer's software, which I am unable even to run,
there's a SourceForge project UTAC which wraps the basic interface with
a large amount of other stuff. I'm not willing to even try running this
(it's Windows-only).

The UTAC code appears to be reverse engineered from the original software.
Unfortunately it's in some .NET language and the quality of the code
makes me want to throw up. I'm not quite sure what the Delay() function
is supposed to be doing because any good compiler would optimise it out.

Example: http://utac.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/utac/trunk/utac/Components/Temper/TEMPerInterface.cs?revision=54&view=markup

It supports the "TEMPer" temperature only device too, but my code only
supports "TEMPerHum" (as far as I know) because that's all I have for
testing.

= Logging =

I've used librrd for storing the data. At the speed required to reliably
access the device, the main loop runs once per second by itself without
the need for special timing. The RRD data file will take up ~400MB unless
you modify the parameters (it's also created on the first run resulting
in a long delay).

= Usage =

Find your device(s). The following lists the physical USB port the device
is connected to. This is used to refer to it for access and as the RRD
filename.

$ ls -1 /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/ttyUSB* -d|cut -d / -f 6|cut -d : -f 1

Run the main process:

$ ./temperhum 1-1.1.3

You'll need this: http://lwn.net/Articles/246334/ until the changes
are merged to Linus' kernel.
